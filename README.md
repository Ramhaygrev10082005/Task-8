## üìò Interview Q&A

**1. What is a VPN?**  
A Virtual Private Network encrypts internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, hiding your real IP.

**2. How does a VPN protect privacy?**  
It encrypts data and masks your location, preventing surveillance and data theft.

**3. Difference between VPN and proxy?**  
VPN encrypts data and hides IP, while a proxy only masks IP without encryption.

**4. What is encryption in VPN?**  
It‚Äôs the process of encoding data so that only authorized parties can access it, preventing eavesdropping.

**5. Can a VPN guarantee complete anonymity?**  
No. It enhances privacy, but user actions and provider policies also affect anonymity.

**6. What protocols do VPNs use?**  
OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec, PPTP, and L2TP.

**7. What are some VPN limitations?**  
Reduced speed, limited features in free versions, and inability to protect against malware or phishing.

**8. How does a VPN affect network speed?**  
It can reduce speed due to encryption and longer routing paths.
